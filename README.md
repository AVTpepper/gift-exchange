# ABOUT "Gift Exchange"
## Intro
During our first meeting we decided on what path we should walk with our topic "Virtual Gift Exchange Platform". The first issue we thought of was that the project is meant to be 100% frontend. That takes away the idea of creating databases with users and gifts that would then be automatically exchanged. [Andy](Andy's LinkedIn) then came up with the idea to create a portal where a user can enter another persons wish and find similar/cheaper options. For example if the user is looking for a gaming console alternative it would provide an image, information and a link to where one can buy an alternative handheld console. However we decided to go with [Alex's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-tastad/) idea and created a platform where the user can buy a gift from three different price ranges and send it to anyone around the world. After chosing the continent the user wants to send the gift to, they recieve a gift themselves which can be claimed by filling out the form below.
